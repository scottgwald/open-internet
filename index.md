# Disorganized additions from meeting on May 7

## Possible Tangible Actions:

- Create a Media Lab Guidebook to Net Neutrality and Related Issues.
- Create a resource to debunk misconceptions / myths about net neutrality
- Compile and publish a “Media Lab” vision of how we feel the internet should be (e.g. Mozilla Manifesto: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/ )
- Compile and publish a list of concrete actions that can be taken
- Compile and publish a list of resources to learn more
- Form a community of leaders around this debate in the ML context (the point here being the fact that ML is a community of makers.)
- Create resources to assist the formation of municipal networks.
- Push for legislation which requires Comcast to disclose network patterns in areas where they form a monopoly.
- Add an explanation of how net neutrality relates to ML mission http://www.media.mit.edu/about/mission-history “Media Lab researchers design technologies for people to create a better future.”
- Can we make a case that a lack of net neutrality would break the types of technologies we create?

## ML Statement on our stance on net neutrality
