# Disorganized additions from meeting on May 7

## Possible Tangible Actions:

- Create a Media Lab Guidebook to Net Neutrality and Related Issues.

- Create a resource to debunk misconceptions / myths about net neutrality

- Compile and publish a “Media Lab” vision of how we feel the internet should
  be (e.g. [Mozilla Manifesto](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/))

- Compile and publish a list of concrete actions that can be taken

- Compile and publish a list of resources to learn more

- Form a community of leaders around this debate in the ML context (the point
  here being the fact that ML is a community of makers.)

- Create resources to assist the formation of municipal networks.

- Push for legislation which requires Comcast to disclose network patterns in
  areas where they form a monopoly.

- Add an explanation of how net neutrality relates to [ML
  mission](http://www.media.mit.edu/about/mission-history) “Media Lab
  researchers design technologies for people to create a better future.”

- Can we make a case that a lack of net neutrality would break the types of
  technologies we create?

## ML Statement on our stance on net neutrality

Everybody write 150 words about where we stand on Net Neutrality.

## What do we need to do to publish a guidebook…

* Identify goals of this guidebook

* Collect / organize relevant information

  - Identify thought leaders

  - Identify topics to include

    - Issue History

    - Infrastructure

    - Laws

    - Stakeholders + Stakeholder Values

    - …?

  - Compile information from thought leaders

* Design the page / site that will present that information

  - Create style guide

  - Design infographics

* Implement the site
